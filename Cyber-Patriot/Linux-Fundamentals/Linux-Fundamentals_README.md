# What's a Linux and Why do I Want One?

Linux is an open-source computer operating system, similar to closed-source solutions you're likely much more familiar with 
like <b>Windows</b> or <b>Mac OSX</b> (open-source means the source code for the software is known and publicly available 
for viewing/use). Linux is a lightweight operating system (OS), making it ideal for use on desktops, servers, IoT (internet 
of things) devices, etc., and is used widely in enterprise and personal environments alike. Learning Linux is an essential 
skill for anyone aspiring to work in IT, and especially in cyber security. In this module, we will cover the basics of Linux 
while learning our way around our Ubuntu VM. Specifically, we will cover the following topics: 

1. Introduction and Learning the Environment
2. Command Line Basics
3. Bash Scripting
4. Users and Groups Administration and Hardening
5. Logging and System Administration
6. Introduction to Linux Exploits
7. Capstone Linux Project - Capture The Flag

As a brief overview, we will learn our way around the operating system and how to do basic user tasks (log in, launch apps, shut down 
the machine, etc), we will explore the command line and learn basic bash commands (cd, pwd, mkdir, touch, mv, cp, sudo, etc), 
we will learn how to bundle these bash commands together into a bash script, we will learn how to create/delete users and groups, 
change passwords, set complexity requirements, etc, we will learn the fundamentals of Linux privilege escalation and exploits (less 
exploit, $PATH variable exploits, insecure binaries, etc), and finally, we will put all of this knowledge together with a Capture the 
Flag event to demonstrate our knowledge.
