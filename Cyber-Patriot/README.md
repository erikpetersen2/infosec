# Cyber Patriot Competition Prep

Hello! My name is Erik Petersen, and I will be your Technical Mentor for this 
year's Cyber Patriot competition! I am so excited to get the opportunity to work 
with you this year and see what we can accomplish. 

# Yeah, but like... who are you? 

Fair question. I would expect nothing less of burgeoning cyber security professionals 
than to have a few questions about my credentials and background. I am an IT and 
cyber security professional who's been in the cyber security space since 2020. 
I currently work as a Desktop Engineer at Ascend Federal Credit Union as well 
as a Cyber Security TA and Instructor for the University of North Carolina at 
Charlotte. I currently hold a number of industry certifications, including 
CompTIA Network+, CompTIA Security+, and eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration 
Tester (eJPT). I hold an AS in Mathematics from Motlow State Community College, 
a certificate in cyber security from Vanderbilt University's Cyber Security Boot Camp, 
and I am slated to graduate in December of 2022 from Western Governor's University 
with a BS in Network Operations and Security. If you would like more information 
regarding my experience, education, or current certifications, feel free to 
visit [my website](https://erikpetersen.tech) where you can view/download my 
resume, find liks to my LinkedIn and GitHub, see some of my current and past 
projects, and (in my opinion) get a sense of my personality. 

# SO HOW DO WE GET STARTED?!?!?

Let's get to it! The first thing we are going to do is get our lab environments 
prepared. To do this, we will need to do a few initial setup steps on our Ubuntu 
VM to get everything ready. Head on over to the Labs-Setup folder and check out 
`Labs-Setup.md` to get started preparing your environment. If you have a laptop 
or desktop at home that meets VMWare's system requirements, you will also find 
a tutorial on setting up a secondary lab environment on your home computer in 
`Home-Lab-Setup.md`. Well, what are you waiting for? LET's GOOOOOOOOO!!!
