This is a collection of scripts I have both written and found useful during my cyber security career. For scripts
where I am not the author, the author's name and a download location will be commented at the end of the script for
clarity's sake. If you find these scripts as useful as I have, please be sure to show your appreciation to their
who have spent countless hours developing these scripts to make our jobs easier.
