# The Metasploit Vulnerability Exploration Lab

In this lab, we will explore the Metasploit framework, including its components
like Searchsploit, MSFVenom, meterpreter, and MSFConsole. 

# What is Metasploit?

The Metasploit framework is a collection of penetration testing tools used by both malicious actors and ethical hackers to find, build, and use exploits, confirm
vulnerabilities on a host or network, and interact with exploited hosts post-exploitation. In this lab, we will use Searchsploit to search the Metasploit database for 
vulnerabilites, MSFConsole to interact with potential exploits and use one to successfully exploit a machine, the Meterpreter shell to interact with our compromised host, and finally MSFVenom to learn how to write our own exploit to perform RCE (remote code execution) on a vulnerable web server. 

# Lab Setup

To prepare for this lab, you will need to launch your Ubuntu virtual machine. For detailed setup instructions, please refer to the `Setting-Up-Your-Lab-Environment.md`
file in `infosec/Labs`. Then run the Metasploit-Lab.sh script in this directory by running the command 

`sudo ./Metasploit-Lab` 

from this directory. From there, you will notice the Terminal window you are in loses the command prompt. Leave this module running in this Terminal window and open up a new window.
